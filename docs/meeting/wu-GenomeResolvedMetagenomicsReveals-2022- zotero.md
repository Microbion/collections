## Abstract

Enhancing soil phosphate solubilization is a promising strategy for agricultural sustainability, while little is known about the mechanisms of how microorganisms cope with differing phosphorus availability. Using a combination of genome-resolved metagenomics and amplicon sequencing, we investigated the microbial mechanisms involved in phosphorus cycling under three agricultural treatments in a wheat-maize rotation system and two natural reforestation treatments. Available soil phosphorus was the key factor shaping bacterial and fungal community composition and function across our agricultural and reforestation sites. Membrane-bound quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase (PQQGDH) and exopolyphosphatases (PPX) governed microbial phosphate solubilization in agroecosystems. In contrast, genes encoding glycerol-3-phosphate transporters (ugpB, ugpC, and ugpQ) displayed a signiﬁcantly greater abundance in the reforestation soils. The gcd gene encoding PQQGDH was found to be the best determinant for bioavailable soil phosphorus. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) afﬁliated with Cyclobacteriaceae and Vicinamibacterales were obtained from agricultural soils. Their MAGs harbored not only gcd but also the pit gene encoding low-afﬁnity phosphate transporters. MAGs obtained from reforestation soils were afﬁliated with Microtrichales and Burkholderiales. These contain ugp genes but no gcd, and thereby are indicative of a phosphate transporter strategy. Our study demonstrates that knowledge of distinct microbial phosphorus acquisition strategies between agricultural and reforestation soils could help in linking microbial processes with phosphorus cycling.
