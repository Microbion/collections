## Abstract

Bacterial communities in soil play a key role in carbon (C) and nutrient cycling. Unravelling how bacterial community assemble and distribute with soil depth is a prerequisite for understanding microbial functions, nutrient cycling and management. Twenty-six rice fields in a typical red soil area in a wet subtropical climate were sampled in the topsoil (0–10 and 10–20 cm) and subsoil (20–40 cm). Physico-chemical soil properties, quantitative fluorescence PCR and high-throughput sequencing were used to analyse the V4 region of 16S rDNA. The rRNA operon copy number and alpha diversity decreased continuously with soil depth because of reduced access to carbon, energy, oxygen and nutrients. The relative abundance of the dominant phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria decreased with increasing soil depth, whereas the opposite trend was observed for the phylum Nitrospirae. The interaction intensity between taxa increased with depth, as limited carbon and nutrients in the undisturbed subsoil lead to the cooccurrence of taxa with similar ecological niches that cooperated to reduce functional redundancy. The higher modularity of the bacterial network in the topsoil is associated with greater environmental perturbations (flooding, fertilization, etc.) to maintain the robustness of the microbial community. Bacterial community assembly processes were stochastic up to 40 cm, but ecological drift was the predominant process in the topsoil, whereas dispersal limitation was dominant in the subsoil. The contribution of abiotic factors (e.g. nutrient and iron contents) and biotic factors (taxa-taxa interactions) as well as dispersal limitations to bacterial community assembly was depth specific. Concluding, the basic principles of bacterial community assembly were evaluated for the first time for a broad range of paddy soils.

土壤中的细菌群落在C和营养循环中起着重要作用。了解微生物群落随着土壤深度的装配和分布是了解微生物功能、养分循环和管理的前提条件。 从湿亚热带气候的典型红壤表层土的26个水稻田取表层土和亚表层土。土壤理化性质，定量PCR和高通量测序分析16Sv4区。rRNA操纵子拷贝数和α多样性随土壤深度降低，由于减少了C、能量和营养的摄入。主要门**Proteobacteria**和**Actinobacteria**随这土壤深度降低，而**Nitrospirae**门升高。类群的相互作用强度随深度增加而增加，因为未扰动土壤中C和营养的限制导致了又相似生态位的类群同时出现，从而协同减少功能冗余。表层土的细菌网络有更高的模块度，表明有更大的环境干扰（ 洪水、肥料，等）以保持微生物群落的稳健性。细菌群落装配过程随机到40cm，但是生态漂移是表层土的主要过程，然而扩散限制在地下是主导。非生物因素和生物因素和细菌装配的扩散限制都是深度特异的。 最后，首次对广泛的水稻土中细菌群落聚集的基本原理进行了评价。
